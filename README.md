# Excel_To_Graphs
A pipeline for plotting data scattered across multiple MS excel files. Customized for my second year MSE222 Materials Science Lab college course. 

The repository contains the initial version of the pipeline (without GUI) and a newer version with a tkinter GUI. Both serve the same purpose; however, the latter was made for my colleagues who were not familiar with CLI.

This project served as my introduction to pandas, tkinter and matplotlib all at the same time. It is also my first use of Python to automate a periodic task.
